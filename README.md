# National Digital Stewardship Residency at MoMA
Repository for sharing the process history metadata template created for the National Digital Stewardship Residency 2014-2015 and the Museum of Modern Art, using METS, PREMIS, PBCore, and reVTMD. This is intended for use describing the process history of time-based media. Also included is a document detailing some of the controlled vocabularies created for this project, heavily specialized to accommodate the specific needs of MoMA's media conservation team.
