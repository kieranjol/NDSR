# National Digital Stewardship Residency at MoMA - forked by Kieran O'Leary in order to utilise the REVTMD section of Peggy's METS doc. Some extra work is in this fork, but development has moved to : https://github.com/kieranjol/IFIscripts/blob/master/generate_blank_revtmd.py
Repository for sharing the process history metadata template created for the National Digital Stewardship Residency 2014-2015 and the Museum of Modern Art, using METS, PREMIS, PBCore, and reVTMD. This is intended for use describing the process history of time-based media. Also included are a best practices guide for applying the template and a document detailing some of the controlled vocabularies created for this project, heavily specialized to accommodate the specific needs of MoMA's media conservation team.
